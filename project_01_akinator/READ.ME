# Project 01: The Pythonator

### Description
In this project, you’ll build a simple “thinking machine” — a Python program that tries to guess what the user is thinking by asking a series of yes/no questions.

You’ll use **variables**, **control flow**, and **Boolean logic** to guide your program through different branches of reasoning. 

The goal: make your Pythonator seem as “smart” (or funny) as possible!

You may also create a different game or app that accomplishes the same goals. 

**Due:** Friday, November 7th

## Learning Objectives

### Primary
- Practice using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Use `input()` and `print()` for user interaction
- Combine logic and creativity to produce different outcomes

### Secondary
- Learn to map a decision tree
- Understand how programs simulate reasoning
- Write organized and readable Python code

## Requirements

Your program must:

- [ ] Ask the user for **their name**
- [ ] Ask **at least 5 yes/no questions**
- [ ] Use **nested `if` statements** for branching logic
- [ ] Contain **3 or more final guesses/outcomes**
- [ ] Use **variables** to track answers or categories
- [ ] Include **one “I give up” or default ending**
- [ ] Include at least **one Easter egg** or hidden response
- [ ] Be formatted neatly with proper indentation and comments

## extra credit points 
If you missed points on the last assignment (or for participation) you may earn extra credit points for doing the following (2 points possible for each). They require research using the internet and I won't accept questions about them.
- [ ] host your game on the internet using github pages and display it using HTML and CSS
- [ ] create a demo video showing off your code and your game
