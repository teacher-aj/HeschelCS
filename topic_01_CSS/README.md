## Lecture Notes: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

1. We will be covering Chapter 3 in Shay Howe's [HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) book.

1. The most important concept to learn is the *CSS selector*.
    1. Must understand the parent/child/sibling/etc relationship between HTML nodes.
    1. CSS selectors will be vital for understanding web scraping.
    1. Quiz [TO DO]

        See `practice_quiz1.pdf` and `practice_quiz2.pdf` for example problems.

        You will have the first 5 minutes of class to complete the quiz in class. After 10 minutes I will ask you to complete the quiz in the hallway. The remainder of the time in class will be used           for labs and work on projects. 

        ```

1. Starting next week, we will focus on back-end dev rather than front-end dev.
    There's a LOT more to front-end dev that we're not covering (we're only doing like 10% of Shay Howe's book),
    and backend devs tend to not know much about frontend dev...
