# Updated Instructions on Publishing Your Website with GitHub Pages

Follow these steps to make your HTML website live on the internet.

---

## 1. Upload Your Files
- Go to your repository on GitHub.  
- Click **Add file → Upload files**.  
- Drag in your website files.  
- Make sure your main file is called **`index.html`** (all lowercase).  
- Scroll down and click **Commit changes** (green button).

---

## 2. Check Your Files
- `index.html` should be in the **main folder** of your repo.  
  - ✅ Good: `index.html` shows up right in the repo.  
  - ❌ Bad: `website/index.html` (inside a folder).  

---

## 3. Turn On GitHub Pages
- Click the **Settings** tab in your repo.  
- On the left, click **Pages**.  
- Under **Branch**, select:
  - **main** (branch)  
  - **root** (folder)  
- Click **Save**.

---

## 4. Wait
- GitHub takes 1–3 minutes to build your site.  
- Refresh the Pages settings page.  
- You’ll see a green box with your site’s link.

---

## 5. Open Your Site
Your website link will look like this:

https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/

yaml
Copy code

Click it and your site should appear!

---

## Troubleshooting
- ✅ Is your file named **index.html**?  
- ✅ Is it in the **root folder** (not inside another folder)?  
- ✅ Did you click **Commit changes** after uploading?  
- ✅ Did you wait a few minutes?

## Lecture Notes: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

1. We will be covering Chapter 3 in Shay Howe's [HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) book.

1. The most important concept to learn is the *CSS selector*.
    1. Must understand the parent/child/sibling/etc relationship between HTML nodes.
    1. CSS selectors will be vital for understanding web scraping.
    1. Quiz [TO DO]

        See `practice_quiz1.pdf` and `practice_quiz2.pdf` for example problems.

        You will have the first 5 minutes of class to complete the quiz in class. After 10 minutes I will ask you to complete the quiz in the hallway. The remainder of the time in class will be used           for labs and work on projects. 

        ```

1. Starting next week, we will focus on back-end dev rather than front-end dev.
    There's a LOT more to front-end dev that we're not covering (we're only doing like 10% of Shay Howe's book),
    and backend devs tend to not know much about frontend dev...
