#### ðŸ“Œ Note: Publishing with GitHub Pages
If you want to make your HTML site live, follow these steps:

1. Upload your files  
   - Go to your repo â†’ **Add file â†’ Upload files**  
   - Make sure your main file is named `index.html`  
   - Click **Commit changes**

2. Turn on Pages  
   - Go to **Settings â†’ Pages**  
   - Under *Branch*, select `main` and `root`  
   - Click **Save**

3. Wait a few minutes  
   - GitHub takes 1â€“3 minutes to build  
   - A green box will appear with your site link

Your site will be available at:  
https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/

## Class A: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

1. We will be covering Chapter 3 in Shay Howe's [HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) book.

1. The most important concept to learn is the *CSS selector*.
    1. Must understand the parent/child/sibling/etc relationship between HTML nodes.
    1. CSS selectors will be vital for understanding web scraping.
    1. Quiz [next Tuesday]

        See `practice_quiz1.pdf` and `practice_quiz2.pdf` for example problems.

        You will have the first 5 minutes of class to complete the quiz in class.
        ```

1. Starting next week, we will focus on back-end dev rather than front-end dev.
    There's a LOT more to front-end dev that we're not covering (we're only doing like 10% of Shay Howe's book),
    and backend devs tend to not know much about frontend dev...
