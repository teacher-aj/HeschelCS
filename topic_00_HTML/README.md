Welcome to our first week of content! 

---

## Class A: Workflow Setup & Intro to Front-End (HTML)

### Do the following:

> **NOTE:**  
> - Throughout this course we will be installing lots of software.  
> - All of the software we use is open source, so you can freely download it and keep access to it after the semester/graduation.  
> - If you change computers, you will need to reinstall the software.  

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).  
   *Note: VS Code includes tracking plugins that allow Microsoft to monitor usage.*

2. Most of our class will take place on GitHub. If you don’t already have an account, [create one here](https://github.com/join).  
   - Choose any username you like.  
   - Keep in mind that GitHub profiles are often shared in job/internship applications, so pick something professional.  
   - Select the **free account** option when prompted.  

3. Press the **Watch** button at the top of this webpage.  

4. Read and follow instructions in **[Issue #320: Meet and Greet Thread]()**.

5. Complete this activity tointroduce you to the structure of an HTML document. By the end, you will have created and opened your very first webpage in a browser.  

  1. Open VS Code 
  
  2. Copy the following code into a new file:  
  
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
       <title>My First Webpage</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This is my very first webpage.</p>
     </body>
     </html>
  3. Save the file as index.html.
  
  4. Open the file in a web browser (double-click the file or right-click → “Open with” → choose your browser).
  
  5. You should now see your first webpage.
  
  **Discuss the following with your partner**:
  
  1. What do the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags mean?
  
  2. What is the difference between <h1> and <p>?
  
  3. Change the text inside the <h1> and <p> tags to make it your own.
  
  **Explore further if you have time**:
  
  Inspect a website
  Right-click on any webpage in your browser and choose Inspect (or Inspect Element). Look at how the HTML structure of a professional site is similar to the one you just wrote. Try finding headings, paragraphs, or images in the code.
  
  Use W3Schools
  Visit the W3Schools HTML Tutorial
   look up what each tag means, and experiment by adding new elements (like another heading or a list) to your page.

## Class B: Lab / Worktime  

### Begin Project 00

**tl;dr**: Create a webpage using HTML and CSS. This week you will complete the first step: making a simple webpage others can view.  
This is the start of [Project 00](/project_00_basic_webpage/).

The lectures/videos won’t cover everything for this lab. The main goal is to get comfortable with documentation—even if that means trial and error.

### Steps:

1. [Follow these directions](https://pages.github.com/) to create a GitHub Pages site.  
   - In the step marked `?` (between step 1 and step 2), select **“I don’t know”** for *What git client are you using?*.  
   - This will guide you to install **GitHub Desktop** for your OS.  

2. (**Extra Credit**) [Set up Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en) and add it to your page.  
   > **NOTE:**  
   > You must insert a `<script>` tag into your HTML.  
   > Each time you update your page, you’ll need to re-upload with GitHub Desktop.  

3. Get at least **5 people** to star your repo on GitHub.  
   - Use class time to trade stars/likes with other students.  
   > **NOTE:**  
   > Stars help boost rankings in GitHub and Google search.  
   > Later, you’ll also need external links to your page. Now is a good time to start trading links (not required for this lab).  

4. Upload your webpage URL to **Schoology**.
