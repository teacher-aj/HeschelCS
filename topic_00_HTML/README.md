## **Class A**: Workflow Setup & Intro to Front-End (HTML)

### Do the following:

> **NOTE:**  
> - Throughout this course we will be installing lots of software.  
> - All of the software we use is open source, so you can freely download it and keep access to it after the semester/graduation.  
> - If you change computers, you will need to reinstall the software.  

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).  
   *Note: VS Code includes tracking plugins that allow Microsoft to monitor usage.*  

2. Most of our class will take place on GitHub. If you don’t already have an account, [create one here](https://github.com/join).  
   - Choose any username you like.  
   - Keep in mind that GitHub profiles are often shared in job/internship applications, so pick something professional.  
   - Select the **free account** option when prompted.  

3. Press the **Watch** button at the top of this webpage.  

4. Read and follow instructions in **[Issue #320: Meet and Greet Thread](https://github.com/teacher-aj/HeschelCS/issues/1)**.

> I will never ask you to do busywork.

### Activity: Build Your First Webpage

> **NOTE:**  
> This activity will introduce you to the structure of an HTML document.  
> By the end, you will have created and opened your very first webpage in a browser.  

1. Open VS Code.  

2. Copy the following code into a new file:  

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
          <title>My First Webpage</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
          <p>This is my very first webpage.</p>
        </body>
        </html>

3. Save the file as `index.html`.  

4. Open the file in a web browser (double-click the file or right-click → “Open with” → choose your browser).  

5. You should now see your first webpage.

## **Class B**: Beginning HTML

#### 1. Discuss the following with your partner:

> **NOTE:**  
> These questions are meant to help you reflect on what each part of your code is doing. After discussing, email me your answer. You may send me one email per group, just make sure to cc your partner.

1. What do the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags mean?  
2. What is the difference between `<h1>` and `<p>`?  

---

#### 2. Explore further:

1. **Use W3Schools**  
   Visit the [W3Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) to look up several tags mean, and experiment by adding new elements to your webpage (like another heading or a list) to your page.   


##### 4. Setup the basic framework for your first website:

1. [Follow these directions]([https://pages.github.com/](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)) to create a GitHub Pages site.  
   -In this step you are essentially uploading the website that you made, to be hosted on github.
   - In the step marked `?` (between step 1 and step 2), select **“I don’t know”** for *What git client are you using?*.  
   - This will guide you to install **GitHub Desktop** for your OS.  

2. [Set up Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en) and add it to your page.  
   > **NOTE:**  
   > You must insert a `<script>` tag into your HTML.  
   > Each time you update your page, you’ll need to re-upload with GitHub Desktop.
   > Quick Google Analytics Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL61v47WyHs)

3. Get at least **5 people** to star your repo on GitHub.  
   - Use class time to trade stars/likes with other students.  
   > **NOTE:**  
   > Stars help boost rankings in GitHub and Google search.  
   > Later, you’ll also need external links to your page. Now is a good time to start trading links (not required for this lab).  

4. Upload your webpage URL to **Schoology**.

# Week 02: HTML Continued

Welcome back. The goal of this week is to work on a bulk of project_00. I will be gone on a 7th grade trip on Monday. Expect to be challenged. Rely on your resources both in person and online!

## **Class A**: Finishing up preliminary tasks and working on your website

#### 1. Check the tasks from the previous weeks

  - Before beginning the tasks for class today I would reccomend taking a look at the tasks from the prior week. Especially tasks with designated actions (i.e. email me)
  - Before beginning this classes tasks you should have the following:
    - a github account (reply to the meet and greet)
    - a webpage hosted on that github account
      - I updated the directions link for github pages, so if you were having trouble with this I would try again
    - a basic comfortability with HTML (What HTML stands for and what it’s used for, Basic document structure (<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>), Headings (<h1>–<h6>'') -->, Paragraphs
      - If you do not, spend some time on w3 schools or talk with your partner through a webpag

#### 2. Begin Project 00

With the remainder of the time that you have, you will be working on our first major project of the year [Project 00](/project_00_basic_webpage/).

The lectures/videos won’t cover everything for this lab. The main goal is to get comfortable with documentation—even if that means trial and error.
