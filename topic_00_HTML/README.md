# Week 00: Front-end web development

Welcome to our first week of content! Wepages are i

**Class 2:** Introduction to Front-End Development (HTML)

**Class 3:** Lab/Worktime 

1. Prelecture videos (Homework):

    > **NOTE:**
    > You will not be directly graded on the content of these videos,
    > but they provide useful background information that will make lectures much easier to follow.
    > Watching them will help you use the classtime for the harder stuff
    > I understand the temptation to not watch them, but even the most technically inclined students will not have seen a lot of the information in these videos.
    >
    > One of the [three virtues of a programmer is laziness](https://thethreevirtues.com/).
    > I am lazy and I hope to train you all to be lazy in this course. 
    > So one of my commitments to you all is that I will never ask you to do busywork.


    Watch the following videos if you don't already understand the key terms listed below.

    1. [How the web works - the big picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHvdBlSxug)

        Key terms you should understand:
        * Browser
        * Server
        * URL
        * Domain
        * IP Address
        * DNS
        * HTML
        * CSS
        * Javascript
        * HTTP
        * HTTPS

    1. [Three types of web development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg0Q_YaQ3Gk)

        Key terms you should understand:
        * Static websites
        * Static site generator
        * Dynamic websites
        * Single page apps

1. Prelecture tasks:

    > **NOTE:**
    >
    > Throughout this course we will be installing lots of software.
    > You are welcome to use your personal macbook or PC (if you have computer issues come see me and we can figure something out)
    > All of the software we use is open source, so you can freely download it on your own machine and keep access to it after the semester/graduation.
    > If you change computers, you will have to reinstall the needed software.

    1. [Install Microsoft's VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
        The only difference is that VSCode contains additional tracking plugins that allows Microsoft to monitor what you do and run code on your computer,
        which.

    1. Most of out class will take place on GitHub. If you do not have an account,
       then. (Update 9/4: Hold off on this for now) [create one](https://github.com/join).

       You may choose any username that you like.
       Job/internship applications commonly ask for GitHub profiles,
       so you should pick something professional that you would want to share with them.

       When prompted for the account type, choose the free account option.

1. Cheatsheets

    In this class, you are encouraged to use cheatsheets for all labs, projects, and quizzes.

    You can find links to the electronic versions of the cheatsheets in this project folder.

    Quizzes will be open note.

## Lab

**tl;dr**
The goal of this lab is to publish a simple webpage online so that others can view it.
This is the first step in completing [project\_00](/project_00_basic_webpage/).

**Homework:**

Ensure that you have pressed the "watch" button at the top of this webpage.
Read and follow the instructions in [Issue #320: the meet and greet thread]().

Watch the following videos if you're not already familiar with their contents:
    
1. [What is github?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)

1. (Optional) [Quick Google Analytics introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL61v47WyHs)

**Instructions:**

The lectures/videos have not explicitly covered how to do most of the tasks in this lab.
The main purpose of this lab is to get you comfortable trying to read and figure out documentation...
even if that means just trying random stuff until it works.

1. [Follow these directions](https://pages.github.com/) to create a GitHub Pages webpage.
   In the step marked `?` (after step `1` and before step `2`),
   select `I don't know` for `What git client are you using?`.
   This will give you instructions on how to install the GitHub Desktop program for your operating system.

1. (Extra Credit) [Follow these instructions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en) to create a Google Analytics account and add Google Analytics to your webpage.

   > **NOTE:**
   > Once again, you must modify your HTML in order to insert the required `<script>` tag into your webpage.
   > Every time you modify your webpage, you must go through the process of uploading with GitHub Desktop.

1. Get at least 5 people to star your webpage's repo on GitHub. I recommend using the class time to trade likes/stars with other students.

   > **NOTE:**
   > The reason for getting these likes and stars is that github and google search also use stars to help rank webpages in search results.
   > More stars means higher rankings in the search results.
   > For the project, you will also have to get links from other webpages.
   > So now would also be a good time to trade these links (although it's not explicitly required for the lab).

1. Upload the url to your completed webpage to schoology.
