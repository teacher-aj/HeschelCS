## Class A: Workflow Setup & Intro to Front-End (HTML)

### Do the following:

> **NOTE:**  
> - Throughout this course we will be installing lots of software.  
> - All of the software we use is open source, so you can freely download it and keep access to it after the semester/graduation.  
> - If you change computers, you will need to reinstall the software.  

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).  
   *Note: VS Code includes tracking plugins that allow Microsoft to monitor usage.*

2. Most of our class will take place on GitHub. If you don’t already have an account, [create one here](https://github.com/join).  
   - Choose any username you like.  
   - Keep in mind that GitHub profiles are often shared in job/internship applications, so pick something professional.  
   - Select the **free account** option when prompted.  

3. Press the **Watch** button at the top of this webpage.  

4. Read and follow instructions in **[Issue #320: Meet and Greet Thread]()**.

## Class B: Lab / Worktime  

### Begin Project 00

**tl;dr**: Create a webpage using HTML and CSS. This week you will complete the first step: making a simple webpage others can view.  
This is the start of [Project 00](/project_00_basic_webpage/).

The lectures/videos won’t cover everything for this lab. The main goal is to get comfortable with documentation—even if that means trial and error.

### Steps:

1. [Follow these directions](https://pages.github.com/) to create a GitHub Pages site.  
   - In the step marked `?` (between step 1 and step 2), select **“I don’t know”** for *What git client are you using?*.  
   - This will guide you to install **GitHub Desktop** for your OS.  

2. (**Extra Credit**) [Set up Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en) and add it to your page.  
   > **NOTE:**  
   > You must insert a `<script>` tag into your HTML.  
   > Each time you update your page, you’ll need to re-upload with GitHub Desktop.  

3. Get at least **5 people** to star your repo on GitHub.  
   - Use class time to trade stars/likes with other students.  
   > **NOTE:**  
   > Stars help boost rankings in GitHub and Google search.  
   > Later, you’ll also need external links to your page. Now is a good time to start trading links (not required for this lab).  

4. Upload your webpage URL to **Schoology**.
