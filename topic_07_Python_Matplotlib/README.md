**Announcements Tuesday 11 Mar:**

1. Quiz Thursday on Python exceptions.

    4 problems, 2 points / problem = 8 points total.

    If you want electronic version of the python problems, you can find them at: <https://github.com/mikeizbicki/quiz/tree/master/quiz_python_with_exceptions/topic05_exceptions>

**Announcements Thursday 13 Mar:**

1. Friday lab session cancelled

    Yuo will still have the assignments due by the end of spring break.

## Lecture Notes

**Class Data:**

Download:

1. The `lab_tweets.py` file.

1. The file `condensed_json_2009.json.zip` from <https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive>.

    To complete the lab, you will need all of the zip files,
    but in class we will just go over the first one.

**Data Analysis:**

We will cover [Chapter 16 - Working with CSV Files and JSON Data](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter16/) of the book.

Reference videos:

1. Corey Schafer's [Working with JSON Data using the json Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N6a-VLBa2I)

We will cover the matplotlib library.
The textbook does not have a chapter on using the matplotlib library,
but the library itself has a great set of tutorials that you can use as a reference:
<https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/tutorials/index.html>

Reference videos:

1. Corey Schafer has a [full set of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_) that covers everything about matplotlib.
   You don't need to watch all of these videos,
   but I recommend watching at least the first one.

The main takeaway from this week is that lots of programming is just:

1. Using other people's libraries

1. And googling how to use their libraries

## Lab

There are two parts to the lab assignments this week:
1. `lab_tweets.py`
2. `lab-part2.py`
Each is worth 2 points and has its own submission on sakai.
