## About the Course

**General Information:**

1. There are no prerequisites for this course.
    1. This course is more practical (and fun!) than the other CS courses.
        1. You will:
            1. Use LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) to code.
                (And learn what they can/can't do.)
            1. Count the number of computers in North Korea connected to the internet.
            1. Build your own Twitter clone.
        1. This course is especially designed to connect computer science to other subjects like
            1. economics,
            1. government,
            1. literature, and
            1. history.
               
     But if you end up really liking it, I hope it sparks a greater interest in computer science in general.     

**Primary Learning Objectives:**

1. **Automate boring tasks** <-- this is a hacker's primary goal

    1. GitHub 
    1. LLMs

**Textbook:**

There is nothing to buy for this class.
All of our references are free (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_as_in_beer).
Some of them are also [free as in speech](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_as_in_speech).

1. Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).
1. Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
1. Lots of other online resources as provided in the weekly schedule.


**Grades:**

| category                      | points/assignment         | *approximate* percentage |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---- |
| Classwork (daily)                    | `2**1` || 20%  |
| quizzes (weekly)              | `2**2` - `2**3`             | 40%  |
| projects (every 2-3 weeks)    | `2**3` - `2**6`             | 40%  |

This will be a low-stress but **very** challenging class.

1. The course is low-stress because you have full control over what your grade will be.
    1. **No midterm/final exam.**
       Weekly quizzes ensure you don't fall behind on material, and if you bomb a quiz it's not a big deal.

       1. Quizzes will be open note.

       1. Final project due during last week of semester.

    1. Most weekly labs are automatically graded by Python.
       Keep working on them until you get 100%.

    1. Projects have TONs of extra credit opportunities.

        Lots of "choose your own adventure" style assignments where you get to decide which tasks you want to complete.

        In the past, some students have:
            1. ended the course with a 150%,
            1. choosen not to complete certain projects because they would get an A without completing them,
            1. go from a 70% to a 100% in the class with the final project.

1. The material is intrinsically *very* hard.

    1.Probably harder than most other elective options
    1. That's why CS/DS majors get paid so much money... there's not many people willing to work hard enough to master these concepts.
    1. The key to success is make the most in-person instruction time. If I have to worry about your behavior in class you will likely worry about your grade

        Historically:
        1. To achieve an A, I estimate that a student will
               - recieve 1 warning for in class behavior every month
               - spend about 2 hours per week outside of class

1. The projects are designed to be fun, real-world projects:

    |     | Project                 | Difficulty    |
    | --- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
    | 0   | Building a Webpage      | Easy          |
    | 1   | Markdown compiler       | Hard          |
    | 2   | Data visualization      | Medium        |
    | 3   | Scraping ebay           | Medium        |
    | 4   | Reddit propaganda bot (maybe swap out with LLM-specific RAG assignment)  | Hard          |
    | 5   | Twitter clone           | Hard          |

    This class has fewer projects than in CS4/CS5/CS51.
    (Those courses have 1 project per week.)

    Our projects more fun/interesting.
    (But maybe a bit harder.)

    Our projects emphasize techniques that LLMs cannot do by themselves.
    (And I will teach you how to use LLMs productively to improve your work.)

    Our projects are "light" versions of projects from [CSCI046 data structures](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci046) and [CSCI143 big data](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci143).
    (Completing these projects gets you a head start in those future classes.)

Your final grade will be computed according to the following table,
with one caveat.

| If your grade satisfies          | then you earn |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 95 &le; grade                    | A             |
| 90 &le; grade < 95               | A-            |
| 87 &le; grade < 90               | B+            |
| 83 &le; grade < 87               | B             |
| 80 &le; grade < 83               | B-            |
| 77 &le; grade < 80               | C+            |
| 73 &le; grade < 77               | C             |
| 70 &le; grade < 73               | C-            |
| 67 &le; grade < 70               | D+            |
| 63 &le; grade < 67               | D             |
| 60 &le; grade < 63               | D-            |
| 60 > grade                       | F             |

*CAVEAT:*
You must complete one of the following "caveat" tasks.
The purpose of this task is to give you non-technical exposure to hacker culture.
Because the task is non-technical, it will not be graded and will not contribute to the numerical score of your grade.
But if you do not complete the task, then you will be docked one letter grade (e.g. an A- becomes a B-).

1. (simple option) Watch the following shows/movies about [cracking](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/cracking.html) and [hacking](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html):

    <!--
    1. Season 1 of Mr. Robot (available on [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00YBX664Q)).
       This is the most accurate portrayal of cracking in any movie, see for example [this article](https://www.pri.org/stories/how-realistic-are-hacks-mr-robot) and [this article](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/real-hackers-behind-mr-robot-get-right/).
    -->

    1. War Games (available on [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Wargames-Matthew-Broderick/dp/B083FY4CDG/)).
       This is a classic hacker movie and was quite realistic for what hacking looked like when the movie was released (1983).

    1. CitizenFour (available for free from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/Citizen.Four2014)).
       This is a documentary about Edward Snowden and the hacking that the NSA does.
       There's also a live-action movie called [Snowden](https://www.amazon.com/Snowden-Joseph-Gordon-Levitt/dp/B01LWYVHKV) that you could also choose to watch.

    1. Zero Days - Security Leaks for Sale (available for free on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BTTiWkdT8Q))
        This documentary explores the [grey hat](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/black-hat.html) world of hackers who develop software to break into computers and sell that software to questionable people... and it's all legal.

1. (more complex option, but allows for more variety) Follow the instructions in the CSCI133 Caveat Task: <https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci143/blob/2025spring/caveat_tasks/culture.md>


See [Issue #260](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/issues/260) for instructions on how to get credit for completing these readings / viewings.

**Late Work Policy:**

You lose `2**(i-1)` points on every assignment,
where `i` is the number of days late.

Do not expect partial credit for incomplete assignments.
It is much better to submit a correct assignment late than an incorrect one on time.

**Collaboration Policy:**

You are encouraged to discuss all labs and projects with other students,
subject to the following constraints:

1. You must be the person typing in all code for your assignments.
1. If you ask someone for help: you may show your code to the other person, but you may not view their code.

You may use any online resources you like as references (including LLMs!) without restriction.

Basically, I'm trusting you all to be adults.
You are ultimately responsible for ensuring you learn the material!
So do what will help you learn best.

> **WARNING:**
> All material in this class is cumulative.
> If you work "too closely" with another student on an assignment,
> you won't understand how to complete subsequent assignments,
> and you will quickly fall behind.
> You should view collaboration as a way to improve your understanding,
> not as a way to do less work.

## Accommodations for Disabilities

I've tried to design the course to be as accessible as possible for people with disabilities.
(We'll talk a bit about how to design accessible software in class too!)
If you need any further accommodations, please ask.

I want you to succeed and I'll make every effort to ensure that you can.
