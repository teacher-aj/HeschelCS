> **NOTE:** 
> If you believe that one of these checkboxes is not appropriate for your webpage for some reason,
> post an issue to github and I may grant you an exception.

> **NOTE:**
> We did not cover in class how to complete the *italicized* steps above,
> and this was intentional.
> You will have to use google/Flint/the textbook to figure these out for yourself.
> No programmer 100% understands HTML or CSS, and so everyone relies on looking up information while coding.
> The purpose of making you do things not covered in class is to get you practice relying on external resources.
